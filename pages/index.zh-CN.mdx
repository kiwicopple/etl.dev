# ETL: Extract, Transform, Load (CN)

In computing, extract, transform, load is a three-phase process where data is extracted from a source, transformed, and loaded into a new destination.

## What Is ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)?

ETL stands for Extract, Transform, Load. It's a process used in data warehousing that involves:

- **Extracting** data from various source systems.
- **Transforming** the data into a suitable format for analysis.
- **Loading** it into a final target database, data warehouse, or data lake.

## Importance of ETL in Data Processing

ETL is vital for data-driven decision making as it:

- Consolidates diverse data into a unified format.
- Ensures data quality and accuracy.
- Facilitates efficient data storage and analysis.

## ETL Workflow Overview

The typical ETL workflow consists of three stages:

1. **Extract:** Data is collected from multiple source systems, which can vary in format and structure.
2. **Transform:** The extracted data undergoes cleaning, validation, and conversion to fit the target schema.
3. **Load:** The transformed data is transferred into the data warehouse for storage and analysis.

## Key Concepts in ETL

Understanding these key concepts is essential in ETL:

- **Data Integration:** Combining data from different sources into a single, cohesive view.
- **Data Cleansing:** Improving data quality by correcting inaccuracies.
- **Data Transformation:** Converting data from one format or structure into another.
- **Batch Processing vs. Real-Time Processing:** Deciding between processing data in large batches or in a continuous, real-time manner.
